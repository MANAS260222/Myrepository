This repository is Manas Polavarapu's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project.This will explain all of the steps of the files and how to recreate and run anaylsis on the Human Activity dataset below.

The dataset is http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The files that are included in this project are the run_anaylsis.r, FinalData.txt, and the Coursebook.md.

In the Coursebook(Coursebook.md) I explain how I used the variables,data and thier transformations to make and clean the data.

In the run_anaylsis.r, I first make the data prepared and then follow the five steps outlined below
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
