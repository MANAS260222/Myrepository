This is my codebook for the run_anaylsis.r script.
This file performs the preparement of the data and then does a  5 steps process.
First you must download the dataset
  you may do this by downloading and extracting under the folder UCI HAR Dataset
Second  assign the data to specific variables
  features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
  The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
  activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
  List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
  subjecttest <- test/subjecttest.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
  contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
  xtest <- test/xtest.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
  contains recorded features test data
  ytest <- test/ytest.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
  contains test data of activities’code labels
  subjecttrain <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
  contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
  xtrain <- test/xtrain.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
  contains recorded features train data
  ytrain <- test/ytrain.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
  contains train data of activities’code labels
The process starts with 
step 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
  xdatacomb(10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by combining xtrain and xtest using rbind() function
  ydatacomb(10299 rows, 1 column) is created by combining ytrain and ytest using rbind() function
  subjectcomb(10299 rows, 1 column) is created by combining subjecttrain and subjecttest using rbind() function
  wholemerge (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by combining subjectcomb, ydatacomb and xdatacomb using cbind() function
step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
      tidydata (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting wholemerge, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement
step 3:Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      All of the numbers in code column of the tidy are replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable
step 4:you should Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
      code column in tidydata renamed into activities
      All Accel in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
      All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
      All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
      All Magn in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
      All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
      All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
 step 5: From the data set in step 4, you must creates a second, you create a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
      final (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing tidydata taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
      Export final into FinalData.txt file.
